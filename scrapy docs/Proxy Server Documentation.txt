# Using Proxy server with Scrapy project (Static site)
	- Install proxy rotating package
		>> pip install scrapy-rotating-proxies

	- Follow settings on this project this url
		>> https://github.com/TeamHG-Memex/scrapy-rotating-proxies

	- Most important settings:
		>> ROTATING_PROXY_PAGE_RETRY_TIMES=2
		   ROTATING_PROXY_BACKOFF_BASE=100
		   ROTATING_PROXY_CLOSE_SPIDER=False

	- Add proxy list file in Scrapy project root directory and add this settings
		>> from pathlib import Path
		   filepath=Path("ip.txt")
		   ROTATING_PROXY_LIST_PATH = filepath

	- It is recomendent to use paid proxy

# Scrapy ratating proxy doesn't work with Selenium.

# It is wise full to use Scrapy-Selenium in a script not full project.
  Write full webscraping code on script.

# To use Selenium proxy you can follow the script file.
